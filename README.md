# Hestia-android-app

Welcome to the gitlab of Hestia.  
This is a school project, we made an android application.

## To run the android application 

1. You just have to download all the files of our gitlab, then put these files into a single folder.
2. Launch Android Studio, click in the top left corner on "File" and then click on "Open".
3. Now you just have to click on the folder of the project and Android studio will open it for you.
4. Connect a device or install a virtual device to see what we've made!

## What's missing and was important to demonstrate/illustrate
With a RecyclerView and a json file or an connection with an API, display the right informations line by line for the appartments.  
Unfortunatelly, not enough time for this.


### If you are facing any issue with this app, you can add a ticket in this gitlab.
